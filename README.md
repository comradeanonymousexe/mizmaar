# Mizmaar - Initiative to Arabic guidence




## Issues (Fix these): 

	-> Home page buttons, when all dropped down- exceeds the height in mobile screen. Looks bad, try if this could be fixed.
	-> Adjust some colors and hover colors, to look more aligned with the theme. 
	-> Implement Translation (Bangla to English)

	-> [DONE] particles-js (those roaming dots) was supposed to interact, make it work. Also separatize the particles-js script from the html file to another js file. 
	Replace the CDNs with actual source code.
