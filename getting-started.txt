Up next, let's delve deeper into the topic of Second Language Acquisition or SLA. [For Nerds only, this section may be skipped. Go to the story of Hare and Tortoise.]




**SLA**

SLA should mimic First Language Acquisition (L1) in every way. For example- being immersed to the environment of that language, listening and Comprehensibly Inputting BEFORE jumping into Reading-Writing (as in conventional language learning process, they start from writing and Grammers) 

**Comprehensible Input**: Stephen Krashen reminds us of the importance of comprehensible input â€“ that's exposing yourself to language in a way that you can understand without learning it, just like a baby learning to babble before speaking in full sentences.


We should let words and sounds pass through our sub-conscious mind and often store them in working memory.Plus rote the words and phrases.Eventually they will be set on the Procedural memory and come as a second nature.

Pictoral relating is crucial in SLA. we often run a translation scheme when speaking L2, That is - internally relating the word with L1 expression first then the object or idea itself. Making the process inefficient. 
Rather direct association of word and meaning should be practiced. 

Benny Lewis, the Irish Polyglot, adviced to speak from the day one. Don't hesitate sounding broken.

Krashen also tells about
**Affective Filter Hypothesis**: The learner should not experience high levels of stress or anxiety during the learning process. Additionally, the learner should feel motivated to participate in learning activities without worrying about making mistakes.

However, it's comparatively difficult to "acquire" any L2 for grown ups like L1. 
The **Critical Period** Hypothesis by Eric Lenneberg suggests that there's a window of opportunity in childhood when language acquisition is at its prime. As we age, it's more challenging. 

Noam Chomskys Universal Grammer theory tells about our possession of innate language capacity, entailing some may require bit more practice. 

So putting them altogether- Here's our To-Do [Extremist Version]

1. Make Arabic contents appear on all of your online feed, no matter you understand or not.

2. Never consciously use L1, when you know the Arabic of that phrase or word. Effective for keeping in procedural memory.

3. Surround yourself with Arabic speakers and learners. Reflective learning is crucial.

4. At first go for comprehensible inputs and acquire vocubs, use them regularly. Stack everyday. Insert Arabic in daily basis.

5. Secondly reflect on basic reading and writing, making sure you bridge them altogether with 4. Perfection of this stage is being able to read Quran fluently, and acquisition of phonetics (Tajweed)

6. As you progress, complex sentence building and basic grammers will intuitively come by. At this stage, recollect them and do some academic grammers. 

7. Make puns and memes in arabic,mention poems and phrases often.

8. Write daily. Delve into rhetorics.

9. You are above instructions now.
