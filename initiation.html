                    Dear Arabic Enthusiasts,


                    Learning Arabic, more than a mere language, is your key to a treasure trove of ancient wisdom. It

                    Now, let's delve deeper into the topic of Second Language Acquisition or SLA. <i>[

            <h2 class="underline-on-hover">Second Language Acquisition</h2>
            <div class="lead">
                <p>
                    SLA should mimic First Language Acquisition (L1) in every way. For example- being immersed to the
                    environment of that language, listening and Comprehensibly Inputting BEFORE jumping into
                    Reading-Writing
                    (as in conventional language learning process, they start from writing and Grammers)
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="highlight-gr">Comprehensible Input</span>: Stephen Krashen reminds us of the importance
                    of comprehensible input that's
                    exposing yourself to language in a way that you can understand without learning it, just like a baby
                    learning to babble before speaking in full sentences.
                    <br><br>

                    We should let words and sounds pass through our sub-conscious mind and often store them in working
                    memory.Plus rote the words and phrases.Eventually they will be set on the Procedural memory and come
                    as
                    a second nature.
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="highlight-gr">Pictoral relating </span>is crucial in SLA. we often run a translation
                    scheme when speaking L2, That is -
                    internally relating the word with L1 expression first then the object or idea itself. Making the
                    process
                    inefficient. <br>
                    Rather direct association of word and meaning should be practiced.
                    <br><br>

                    Benny Lewis, the Irish Polyglot, adviced to speak from the day one. Don't hesitate sounding broken.
                    <br>

                    Krashen also tells about
                    <span class="highlight-rd">Affective Filter Hypothesis</span> The learner should not experience high
                    levels of stress or anxiety
                    during the learning process. Additionally, the learner should feel motivated to participate in
                    learning
                    activities without worrying about making mistakes.
                    <br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, it's comparatively difficult to "acquire" any L2 for grown ups like L1. <br><br>
                    The <span class="highlight-rd">Critical Period</span> Hypothesis by Eric Lenneberg suggests that
                    there's a window of opportunity in childhood when language acquisition is at its prime. As we age,
                    it's more challenging. <br>
                    Noam Chomsky's Universal Grammar theory tells about our possession of innate language capacity,
                    entailing some may require bit more practice. <br><br>
                    
                </p>
                <h2 class="underline-on-hover" id="steps">Steps</h2>
                <p>Here's a rough plan on how should we approach learning the language. Feel free to come up with your own design</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="underline-rd">Make Arabic Contents Appear</span> on all of your online feed, no
                        matter you understand or not. <br></li>
                    <br>
                    <li><span class="underline-rd">Never consciously use L1</span>, when you know the Arabic of that
                        phrase or word. Effective for adopting in procedural memory. <br></li>
                    <br>
                    <li><span class="underline-rd">Surround yourself with Arabic speakers</span> and learners.
                        Reflective learning is crucial. <br></li>
                    <br>
                    <li><span class="underline-rd">At first go for comprehensible inputs</span> and acquire vocabs,
                        <span class="highlighted-gr">use them regularly</span>. Stack every day. Insert Arabic on a
                        daily basis.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>You should <span class="underline-rd"> speak daily with fellow learners</span>. Each time, integrate what you have learned so far.</li>
                    <li>Then reflect on basic reading and writing.
                        Perfection of this stage is being able to read Quran fluently, and acquisition of phonetics
                        (Tajweed).</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>After that <span class="underline-rd">embrace advanced reading capability</span> - That is, to be able to read without I'rabs/Short Vowels (You'll get to know what it is) </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>As you progress, complex sentence building and basic grammars will intuitively come by. At this
                        stage, <span class="underline-rd">recollect them and do some academic grammars</span>.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><span class="underline-rd">Make puns and memes in Arabic</span>, mention poems and phrases
                        often. Write on social medias and send voices with fellow learners</li>

                <p>
                    On a beautiful <span class="highlight-bl">sabah</span> (morning) in a serene <span
                        class="highlight-bl">qaryah</span> (village), the swift hare approached the slow tortoise.
                    "<span class="highlight-bl">Sabah al-khair</span>! (Good morning)" the hare greeted with a grin.
                    "How about a race <span class="highlight-bl">al-yaum</span> (today)?"
                </p>

                <p>
                    The tortoise, polite as ever, responded, "<span class="highlight-bl">Jayyid</span> (Fine) , Hare! A
                    race sounds interesting."
                    The entire <span class="highlight-bl">qaryah</span> soon buzzed with excitement. Every <span
                        class="highlight-bl">hayawaan</span> (animal) gathered to witness the thrilling race. The
                    tortoise and the hare lined up, and with a hearty "Ready, set, go!" from the wise <span
                        class="highlight-bl">qittah</span> (cat), the race began.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The hare sprinted ahead with impressive speed, leaving the tortoise behind. "<span
                        class="highlight-bl">Ana</span> ( I ) will see you at the finish line, Tortoise!" he shouted,
                    and off he went.
                    The tortoise, undeterred, plodded on steadily, passing by villagers who cheered him on. "<span
                        class="highlight-bl">Anta</span> (You) can do it, Tortoise!" they shouted.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The hare, in the lead, soon spotted a <span class="highlight-bl">bataata</span> (potato) field. He
                    couldn't resist his favorite snack, so he said "I'll just have a quick bite."
                    Meanwhile, the tortoise continued on his slow but unwavering pace. As <span
                        class="highlight-bl">Hua</span> (he) passed the <span class="highlight-bl">bataata</span> field,
                    he noticed the hare munching away.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The tortoise called out, "<span class="highlight-bl">Marhaba</span> (Awesome)! I hope you enjoy your
                    <span class="highlight-bl">ta-aam</span> (meal). I'll keep moving."
                    The hare, mouth full of carrot, mumbled, "Oh, <span class="highlight-bl">Ana</span> (I'm) so <span
                        class="highlight-bl">Sari'</span> (fast), I have plenty of <span
                        class="highlight-bl">wakt</span> (time.) "
                </p>

                <p>
                    The <span class="highlight-bl">shams</span> (sun) began to set as the tortoise approached the <span
                        class="highlight-bl">khatam</span> (finish) line. Villagers greeted him with smiles and a "Masaa
                    al-khair!" (Good evening)!
                    The hare, having overstayed his break, finally raced toward the finish line. He arrived late and out
                    of breath, realizing his <span class="highlight-bl">khata</span> (mistake).
                </p>

                <p>
                    The tortoise won the race, demonstrating the <span class="highlight-bl">quwwat</span> (power) of
                    consistency and determination. The hare learned a valuable <span class="highlight-bl">dars</span>
                    (lesson) about humility and respecting others.
                    And from that <span class="highlight-bl">yaum</span> (day) on, the villagers often said to the Hare-
                    "<span class="highlight-bl">Baraqallahu</span> (may Allah give plentifulness) <span
                        class="highlight-bl">fi</span> (in) <span class="highlight-bl">ta-aamika</span> (your food) !""

                    Once upon a time in a vibrant <span class="highlight-bl">sooq</span> (Market) in a bustling Arabic
                    <span class="highlight-bl">madina</span> (town), there lived a curious young <span
                        class="highlight-bl">walad</span> (boy). "Ismuhu" (His name was) Sami. Sami had a penchant for
                    adventure and a <span class="highlight-bl">Qalb</span> (heart) full of curiosity. "<span
                        class="highlight-bl">Kullu yaum</span>" (Every day), he wandered through the <span
                        class="highlight-bl">Sooq</span> (market), listening to the chattering of the merchants and the
                    enchanting melodies of the Oud playing in the background.

                <p>
                    One sunny <span class="highlight-bl">sabah</span> (morning), Sami decided to embark on a grand

                        class="highlight-bl">kaana yagsilu</span> (bathing) in the golden glow of the <span
                        class="highlight-bl">shams</span> (sun).
                </p>
                <p>
                    As Sami ventured deeper into the desert, the winds whispered tales of ancient <span
                        class="highlight-bl">qasr</span> (castles) and hidden treasures. He met a friendly nomad who
                    offered to "<span class="highlight-bl">hidayat</span>" (guide) him through the arid landscape. <span
                        class="highlight-bl">Kaana Yaqulu</span> (they told) stories of their <span
                        class="highlight-bl">ahl</span> (families) and laughed together under the vast <span
                        class="highlight-bl">samaa</span> (sky).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Suddenly, they stumbled upon a <span class="highlight-bl">A'jeeb</span> (mysterious) cave entrance.
                    Sami's heart raced with excitement. With a mischievous grin, the nomad said, "This is the entrance
                    to the <span class="highlight-bl">ghawur</span> (cave) of 'Aladdin.'" Sami's eyes widened in
                    amazement, and he thought of the magical <span class="highlight-bl">jinn</span> (genie) that might
                    be hidden inside.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="highlight-bl">Hoom</span> (they) ventured deep into the <span
                        class="highlight-bl">ghawur</span> cave, the walls adorned with dazzling <span
                        class="highlight-bl">jawahir</span> (jewels) that glistened in the faint light. As they delved
                    further, they discovered a chest filled with precious "<span class="highlight-bl">zahab</span>"
                    (gold) and <span class="highlight-bl">Naqds</span> (money). It was a treasure beyond Sami's wildest
                    <span class="highlight-bl">Ru'ya</span> (dream).
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="highlight-bl">laakin</span> (However), their <span class="highlight-bl">suroor</span>
                    (joy) was short-lived when they heard the rumbling of a <span class="highlight-bl">jamal</span>
                    (camel) outside the cave. It was the <span class="highlight-bl">maalik</span> (owner) of the
                    treasure, an old <span class="highlight-bl">zaalim</span> (tyrant) landlord who had been keeping his
                    riches there. Sami <span class="highlight-bl">kaana ya'lamu</span> (knew) they had to make a quick
                    escape.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As they rushed out of the cave, the man yelled, <span class="highlight-bl">Qif!</span> (Stop!), but
                    they were already on their <span class="highlight-bl">tayyara</span> (airplane)!, ready to soar to
                    safety. With the treasure in tow, they ran over the vast dessert, leaving the merchant far behind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The nomad chuckled, "We truly have the <span class="highlight-bl">baraqah</span> (blessing) of
                    'Aladdin' with us today." Sami nodded, [realizing that their adventure had led to not only riches
                    but also a wealth of new Arabic words and phrases (: ] He couldn't wait to share his <span
                        class="highlight-bl">qissah</span> (story) with his fellow townsfolk.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Back in the bustling bazaar, Sami regaled his friends with the thrilling tale of their desert
                    adventure. <span class="highlight-bl">Ta'allama</span> (He taught) them the Arabic words he had
                    learned from the nomad along the way, and they listened in awe as they savored <span
                        class="highlight-bl">qahwa</span> (coffee) and <span class="highlight-bl">luban</span> (yogurt)
                    in the shade of the <span class="highlight-bl">shajara</span> (tree).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sami's story became legendary in the town, and he was known as the <span
                        class="highlight-bl">qasas</span> (storyteller) who brought the magic of the Arabic language to
                    life. His friends, inspired by his journey, decided to embark on their own adventures, each hoping
                    to discover hidden treasures (and new words), just like Sami.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And so, the vibrant bazaar continued to thrive, filled with laughter, stories, and the <span
                        class="highlight-bl">Haseen</span> (beautiful) tapestry of the Arabic language, thanks to the
                    young boy who dared to dream and explore the world beyond him.

                        class="highlight-bl">al-yaum</span> (today). My daily life is quite unique, I must say. <span

                        class="highlight-bl">Ashra-'u</span> (I start) my day with a big smile and a steaming cup of
                    <span class="highlight-bl">qahwa</span> (coffee) that's so strong, it could wake up a <span
                        class="highlight-bl">mayyit</span> (dead) person!
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Zayd:</strong> <span class="highlight-bl">Shukran laka</span> (Thank you) for
                    having us, Sami. So, what's <span class="highlight-bl">baa'd</span> (next) in your daily routine?
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Sami:</strong> Well, after my coffee, <span class="highlight-bl">Uhibbu</span> (I like) to
                    walk through the <span class="highlight-bl">suq</span> (market) where one of the vendors is a <span
                        class="highlight-bl">maahir</span> (master) of <span class="highlight-bl">tajweed</span>
                    (Quranic Phonetics). It's like music to my ears. I usually pick up some <span
                        class="highlight-bl">khubz</span> (bread) and <span class="highlight-bl">zayt</span> (olive oil)
                    for breakfast, <span class="highlight-bl">ta'lamu</span> (you know), to keep it traditional.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Zays:</strong> Sounds delightful. <span class="highlight-bl">Kaifa
                        Yaumuka</span> (How's your day) after that?
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Sami:</strong> Oh, you won't believe it. I have a pet <span
                        class="highlight-bl">namar</span> (tiger) named Abu Jandal who joins me for breakfast. We share
                    <span class="highlight-bl">tamar</span> (dates) and <span class="highlight-bl">a'sal</span> (honey)
                    together. He's a bit of a <span class="highlight-bl">fitna</span> (troublemaker), but we get along
                    just fine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Omar:</strong> That's quite an unusual pet, Sami. What's on your agenda for the
                    rest of the day?
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Sami:</strong> Well, after my unusual breakfast, I head to the <span
                        class="highlight-bl">maktab</span> (office) where I work as a <span
                        class="highlight-bl">kaatib</span> (scribe). I transcribe the most thrilling stories, and
                    sometimes I even add a dash of <span class="highlight-bl">hikayah</span> (stories) and <span
                        class="highlight-bl">Ash'aar</span> (poems) to make it more interesting. My boss is a
                    perfectionist, so I have to be very precise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Ubaida:</strong> How intriguing! And what about your <span
                        class="highlight-bl">gadaa</span> (lunch) break?
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Sami:</strong> Ah, lunchtime is a real treat. I often visit the local <span
                        class="highlight-bl">matbakh</span> (kitchen) where a <span class="highlight-bl">tabbakh</span>
                    (chef) cooks the spiciest <span class="highlight-bl">harra</span> (spicy) dishes you can imagine. I
                    love a bit of <span class="highlight-bl">laahm</span> (meat) with <span
                        class="highlight-bl">batata</span> (potatoes). It's like a party in my <span
                        class="highlight-bl">faam</span> (mouth), <span class="highlight-bl">Aquulu</span> (I tell) you!
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Ibnul Ard:</strong> Sami, your <span class="highlight-bl">Hayaat</span> (life) is full

                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Sami:</strong> <span class="highlight-bl">Amma</span> (well), <span class="highlight-bl">fi
                        al-masaa</span> (in the evening), I like to relax with some <span
                        class="highlight-bl">shai</span> (tea) and read <span class="highlight-bl">kutub</span> (books)
                    about far-off lands and <span class="highlight-bl">dawlah</span> (countries). It's a great way to
                    expand my <span class="highlight-bl">ilm</span> (knowledge).
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Ibnul Ard:</strong> Thanks for sharing it with us. Any parting words?
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Sami:</strong> <span class="highlight-bl">Shukran</span> for spending time with me, my
                    friends. <span class="highlight-bl">I'lam</span> (Remember), life is like a <span
                        class="highlight-bl">qasr</span> (castle) filled with endless surprises. Embrace the unexpected,
                    and you'll discover the beauty of every <span class="highlight-bl">layl</span> (night) and <span
                        class="highlight-bl">nahaar</span> (day).
                </p>
                <p>
                    And with that, Sami leaves us with a smile, ready to embark on another quirky day in his
                    extraordinary life.
